# Drivers
Scripts to handle running, testing, and benchmarking code generated by LLMs.
The drivers are split up by language.

## Running the prompts
Given a prompt and output data set in `generated-outputs.json` you can run each
of the generated outputs using the below command.

```bash
python run-all.py generated-outputs.json
```

## Organization of Drivers
Within `drivers/` there are subdirectories for each programming language.
In this subdirectory is a `*_driver_wrapper.py` file that handles running
code for that language.
This wrapper further uses functionality from drivers in `models/` and 
`benchmarks/` in the language subdirectory.
These define behavior for running each programming model and benchmark.
