/* Solve the sparse linear system Ax=b for x.
   A is a sparse NxN matrix in COO format. x and b are dense vectors with N elements.
   Use MPI to compute in parallel. Assume MPI has already been initialized.
   Every rank has a complete copy of A and b. Store the result in x on rank 0.
   Example:
   
   input: A=[{0,0,1}, {0,1,1}, {1,1,-2}] b=[1,4]
   output: x=[3,-2]
