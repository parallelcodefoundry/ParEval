/* Solve the sparse linear system Ax=b for x.
   A is a sparse NxN matrix in COO format with sizeA elements. x and b are dense vectors with N elements.
   Use CUDA to compute in parallel. The kernel is launched with at least sizeA threads.
   Example:
   
   input: A=[{0,0,1}, {0,1,1}, {1,1,-2}] b=[1,4]
   output: x=[3,-2]
