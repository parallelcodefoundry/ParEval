/* Return the index of the first even number in the vector x.
   Use MPI to parallelize the search. Assume MPI has already been initialized.
   Every rank has a complete copy of x. Return the result on rank 0.
   Examples:

   input: [7, 3, 9, 5, 5, 7, 2, 9, 12, 11]
   output: 6

   input: [3, 8, 9, 9, 3, 4, 8, 6]
   output: 1
