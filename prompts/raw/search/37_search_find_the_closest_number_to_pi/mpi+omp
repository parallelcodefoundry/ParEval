/* Return the index of the value in the vector x that is closest to the math constant PI.
   Use M_PI for the value of PI.
   Use MPI and OpenMP to search in parallel. Assume MPI has already been initialized.
   Every rank has a complete copy of x. Return the result on rank 0.
   Example:

   input: [9.18, 3.05, 7.24, 11.3, -166.49, 2.1]
   output: 1
