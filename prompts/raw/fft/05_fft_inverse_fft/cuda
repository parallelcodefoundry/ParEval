/* Compute the inverse fourier transform of x in-place.
   Use CUDA to compute in parallel. The kernel is launched with at least N threads.
   Example:
   
   input: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
   output: [{0.5,0}, {0.125,0.301777}, {0,-0}, {0.125,0.0517767}, {0,-0}, {0.125,-0.0517767}, {0,-0}, {0.125,-0.301777}]
