/* Compute one iteration of a 3-point 1D jacobi stencil on `input`. Store the results in `output`.
   Each element of `input` will be averaged with its two neighbors and stored in the corresponding element of `output`.
   i.e. output[i] = (input[i-1]+input[i]+input[i+1])/3
   Replace with 0 when reading past the boundaries of `input`.
   Use MPI to compute in parallel. Assume MPI has already been initialized.
   Every rank has a complete copy of input. The result is stored in output on rank 0.
   Example:

   input: [9, -6, -1, 2, 3]
   output: [1, 2/3, -5/3, 4/3, 5/3]
