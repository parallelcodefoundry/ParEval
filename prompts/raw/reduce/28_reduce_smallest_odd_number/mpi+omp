/* Return the value of the smallest odd number in the vector x.
   Use MPI and OpenMP to compute in parallel. Assume MPI is already initialized.
   Every rank has a complete copy of x. Return the result on all ranks.
   Examples:

   input: [7, 9, 5, 2, 8, 16, 4, 1]
   output: 1

   input: [8, 36, 7, 2, 11]
   output: 7
