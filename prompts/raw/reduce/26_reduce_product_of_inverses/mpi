/* Return the product of the vector x with every odd indexed element inverted.
   i.e. x_0 * 1/x_1 * x_2 * 1/x_3 * x_4 ...
   Use MPI to compute product in parallel. Assume MPI has already been initialized.
   Every rank has a complete copy of x. Return the product on all ranks.
   Example:

   input: [4, 2, 10, 4, 5]
   output: 25
