/* Return the product of the vector x with every odd indexed element inverted.
   i.e. x_0 * 1/x_1 * x_2 * 1/x_3 * x_4 ...
   Store the result in product.
   Use AMD HIP to compute product in parallel. The kernel is launched with at least as many threads as values in x.
   Example:

   input: [4, 2, 10, 4, 5]
   output: 25
