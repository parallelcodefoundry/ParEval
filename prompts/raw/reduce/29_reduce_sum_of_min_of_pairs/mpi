/* Return the sum of the minimum value at each index of vectors x and y for all indices.
   i.e. sum = min(x_0, y_0) + min(x_1, y_1) + min(x_2, y_2) + ...
   Use MPI to sum in parallel. Assume MPI has already been initialized.
   Every rank has a complete copy of x and y. Return the sum on all ranks.
   Example:

   input: x=[3, 4, 0, 2, 3], y=[2, 5, 3, 1, 7]
   output: 10
