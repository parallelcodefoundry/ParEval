/* Sort the first half of the vector x in descending order. Leave the second half in-place. 
   If x.size() is odd, then include the middle element in the first half. 
   Use CUDA to sort in parallel. Kernel will be launched with 1 thread per element.
   Examples:
   
   input: [2, 5, -4, 7, 3, 6, -1]
   output: [7, 5, 2, -4, 3, 6, -1]

   input: [-8, 4, 6, 1, 3, 1]
   output: [6, 4, -8, 1, 3, 1]
