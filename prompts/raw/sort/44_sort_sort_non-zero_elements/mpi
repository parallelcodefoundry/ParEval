/* Sort the vector x in ascending order ignoring elements with value 0.
   Leave zero valued elements in-place. 
	 Use MPI to sort x in parallel. Assume MPI is already initialized.
   Every rank has a complete copy of x. Store the result in x on rank 0.
   Example:

   input: [8, 4, 0, 9, 8, 0, 1, -1, 7]
   output: [-1, 1, 0, 4, 7, 0, 8, 8, 9]
