/* For each value in the vector x compute its index in the sorted vector.
   Store the results in `ranks`.
   Use MPI to compute in parallel. Assume MPI has already been initialized.
   Every process has a complete copy of x. Store the result in ranks on process 0.
   Examples:

   input: [3.1, 2.8, 9.1, 0.4, 3.14]
   output: [2, 1, 4, 0, 3]
 
   input: [100, 7.6, 16.1, 18, 7.6]
   output: [4, 0, 1, 2, 3]
