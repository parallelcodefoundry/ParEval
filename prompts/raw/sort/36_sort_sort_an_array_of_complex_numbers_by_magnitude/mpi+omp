/* Sort the vector x of complex numbers by their magnitude in ascending order.
   Use MPI and OpenMP to sort in parallel. Assume MPI has already been initialized.
   Every rank has a complete copy of x. Store the result in x on rank 0.
   Example:
   
   input: [3.0-1.0i, 4.5+2.1i, 0.0-1.0i, 1.0-0.0i, 0.5+0.5i]
   output: [0.5+0.5i, 0.0-1.0i, 1.0-0.0i, 3.0-1.0i, 4.5+2.1i]
