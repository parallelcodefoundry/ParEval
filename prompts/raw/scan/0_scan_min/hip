/* Replace the i-th element of the vector x with the minimum value from indices 0 through i.
   Use AMD HIP to compute in parallel. The kernel is launched with at least as many threads as values in x.
   Examples:

   input: [8, 6, -1, 7, 3, 4, 4]
   output: [8, 6, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

   input: [5, 4, 6, 4, 3, 6, 1, 1]
   output: [5, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 1, 1]
