/* Compute the reverse prefix sum of the vector x into output.
   Use MPI to compute in parallel. Assume MPI has already been initialized.
   Every rank has a complete copy of x. Store the result in output on rank 0.
   Examples:
   
   input: [1, 7, 4, 6, 6, 2]
   output: [2, 8, 14, 18, 25, 26]

   input: [3, 3, 7, 1, -2]
   output: [-2, -1, 6, 9, 12]
