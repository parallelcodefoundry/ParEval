/* Count the number of doubles in the vector x that have a fractional part 
   in [0, 0.25), [0.25, 0.5), [0.5, 0.75), and [0.75, 1). Store the counts in `bins`.
   Use AMD HIP to compute in parallel. The kernel is launched with at least N threads.
   Examples:

   input: [7.8, 4.2, 9.1, 7.6, 0.27, 1.5, 3.8]
   output: [2, 1, 2, 2]

   input: [1.9, 0.2, 0.6, 10.1, 7.4]
   output: [2, 1, 1, 1]
