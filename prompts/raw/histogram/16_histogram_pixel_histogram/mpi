/* Count the number of pixels in image with each grayscale intensity.
   The vector `image` is a grayscale image with values 0-255.
   Store the results in `bins`.
   Use MPI to count in parallel. Assume MPI has already been initialized.
   Every rank has a complete copy of image. The result is stored in bins on rank 0.
   Example:
   
   input: image=[2, 116, 201, 11, 92, 92, 201, 4, 2]
   output: [0, 0, 2, 0, 1, ...]
