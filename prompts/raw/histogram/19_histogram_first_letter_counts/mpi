/* For each letter in the alphabet, count the number of strings in the vector s that start with that letter.
   Assume all strings are in lower case. Store the output in `bins` array.
   Use MPI to compute in parallel. Assume MPI has already been initialized.
   Every rank has a complete copy of s. The result is stored in bins on rank 0.
   Example:

   input: ["dog", "cat", "xray", "cow", "code", "type", "flower"]
   output: [0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
