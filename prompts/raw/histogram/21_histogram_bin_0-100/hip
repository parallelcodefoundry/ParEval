/* Vector x contains values between 0 and 100, inclusive. Count the number of
   values in [0,10), [10, 20), [20, 30), ... and store the counts in `bins`.
   Use AMD HIP to compute in parallel. The kernel is initialized with at least as many threads as values in x.
   Example:

   input: [7, 32, 95, 12, 39, 32, 11, 71, 70, 66]
   output: [1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1]
