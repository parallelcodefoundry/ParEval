struct Point {

/* Count the number of cartesian points in each quadrant. The vector points contains a list of `Point` objects.
   Store the counts in `bins`.
   Use MPI and OpenMP to count in parallel. Assume MPI has already been initialized.
   Every rank has a complete copy of image. The result is stored in bins on rank 0.
   Example:

   input: [{x=1.5, y=0.1}, {x=-3, y=1.1}, {x=5, y=9}, {x=1.5, y=-1}, {x=3, y=-7}, {x=0.1, y=2}]
   output: [3, 1, 0, 2]
