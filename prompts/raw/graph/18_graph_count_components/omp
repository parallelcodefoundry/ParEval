/* Count the number of connected components in the undirected graph defined by the adjacency matrix A.
   A is an NxN adjacency matrix stored in row-major. A is an undirected graph.
	 Use OpenMP to compute in parallel.
   Example:

	 input: [[0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0]]
   output: 2
