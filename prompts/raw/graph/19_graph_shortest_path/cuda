/* Compute the length of the shortest path from source to dest in the undirected graph defined by the adjacency matrix A.
   A is an NxN adjacency matrix stored in row-major. A is an undirected graph.
   Store the result in pathLength.
   Use CUDA to compute in parallel. The kernel is launched on an NxN grid of threads.
   Example:

	 input: [[0, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0]], source=0, dest=3
   output: 2
