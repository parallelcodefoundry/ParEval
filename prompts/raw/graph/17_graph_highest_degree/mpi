/* Compute the highest node degree in the undirected graph. The graph is defined in the adjacency matrix A.
   A is an NxN adjacency matrix stored in row-major. A is an undirected graph.
   Use MPI to compute in parallel. Assume MPI has already been initialized.
   Every rank has a complete copy of A. The result is returned on rank 0.
   Example:

	 input: [[0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]]
   output: 3
