/* Compute the highest node degree in the undirected graph. The graph is defined in the adjacency matrix A.
   A is an NxN adjacency matrix stored in row-major. A is an undirected graph.
   Store the result in maxDegree.
   Use AMD HIP to compute in parallel. The kernel is launched with at least N threads.
   Example:

	 input: [[0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]]
   output: 3
