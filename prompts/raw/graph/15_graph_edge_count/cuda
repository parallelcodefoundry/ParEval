/* Count the number of edges in the directed graph defined by the adjacency matrix A.
   Store the result in numEdges. A represents a directed graph.
   A is an NxN adjacency matrix stored in row-major.
   Use CUDA to compute in parallel. The kernel is launched with at least N threads.
   Example:

	 input: [[0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]]
   output: 3
