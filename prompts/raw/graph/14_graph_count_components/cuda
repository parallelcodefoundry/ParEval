/* Count the number of connected components in the graph defined by the adjacency matrix A.
   A is an NxN adjacency matrix stored in row-major.
	 Use CUDA to compute in parallel. The kernel is launched on an NxN grid of threads.
   Example:

	 input: [[0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0]]
   output: 2
