/* Return the number of vertices in the largest component of the undirected graph defined by the adjacency matrix A.
   A is an NxN adjacency matrix. A is an undirected graph.
   Use Kokkos to compute in parallel. Assume Kokkos has already been initialized.
   Example:

	 input: [[0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0]]
   output: 2
