/* Compute z = alpha*x+y where x and y are vectors. Store the result in z.
   Use MPI to compute in parallel. Assume MPI has already been initialized.
   Every rank has a complete copy of x and y. Store the result in z on rank 0.
   Example:
   
   input: x=[1, -5, 2, 9] y=[0, 4, 1, -1] alpha=2
   output: z=[2, -6, 5, 17]
