/* Solve the linear system Ax=b for x.
   A is an NxN matrix in row-major. x and b have N elements.
   Use MPI to compute in parallel. Assume MPI has already been initialized.
   Every rank has a complete copy of A and b. Store the result in x on rank 0.
   Example:
   
   input: A=[[1,4,2], [1,2,3], [2,1,3]] b=[11, 11, 13]
   output: x=[3, 1, 2]
