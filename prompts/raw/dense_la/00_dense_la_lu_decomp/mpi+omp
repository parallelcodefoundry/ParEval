/* Factorize the matrix A into A=LU where L is a lower triangular matrix and U is an upper triangular matrix.
   Store the results for L and U into the original matrix A. 
   A is an NxN matrix stored in row-major.
   Use MPI and OpenMP to compute in parallel. Assume MPI has already been initialized.
   Every rank has a complete copy of A. Store the result in A on rank 0.
   Example:

   input: [[4, 3], [6, 3]]
   output: [[4, 3], [1.5, -1.5]]
