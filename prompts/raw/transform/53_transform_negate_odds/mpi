/* In the vector x negate the odd values and divide the even values by 2.
   Use MPI to compute in parallel. Assume MPI has already been initialized.
   Every rank has a complete copy of x. The final result is stored on rank 0.
   Example:

   input: [16, 11, 12, 14, 1, 0, 5]
   output: [8, -11, 6, 7, -1, 0, -5]
